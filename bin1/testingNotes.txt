Write some JUnit tests for the “can do?” methods in your model.
Write some JUnit tests verifying that you can successfully initialize your model from
the JSON model data returned by the server.

Model Tests
Test initializing model from server JSON
Test can do methods
canDiscardCards
	wrong turn phase
	



Proxy Tests
Tests are needed for all of the following functions. 
All that needs to be tested is the connection between the Proxy and the Server
Need to test that the connection can be made and the result gives us a 200 OK response.
These tests should all be fairly similar.

doGet
doPost
login
register
list
create
join
save
load
model
reset
sendChat
rollNumber
robPlayer
finishTurn
buyDevCard
YearOfPlenty
RoadBuilding
Soldier
Monopoly
Monument
buildRoad
buildSettlement
buildCity
offerTrade
acceptTrade
maritimeTrade
discardCards
changeLogLevel
addAI
listAI


Poller Tests
Tests to verify that the Poller can update the Model
Should really only need a few tests.
Perhaps one where the model has not changed and one where it has.
