Write some JUnit tests for the “can do?” methods in your model.
Write some JUnit tests verifying that you can successfully initialize your model from
the JSON model data returned by the server.

Write some JUnit tests to verify that your Server Poller is working properly. Use the
“mock” Server Proxy instead of the “real” one so you can run these tests without
needing to run the server. (The tests for your Catan model should already contain
some code to verify that the model can properly initialize itself from JSON data. You
should be able to reuse that code here to ensure that the model has been properly
updated by the poller.)

Proxy Tests
Tests are needed for all of the following functions. 
All that needs to be tested is the connection between the Proxy and the Server
Need to test that the connection can be made and the result gives us a 200 OK response.
These tests should all be fairly similar.
